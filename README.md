This is a recommendation system with a hybrid approach. This approach is used to overcome the weaknesses of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The hybrid approach applied uses one of the Deep Neural Networks, namely the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is expected to help extract content to get recommendation information from content.
